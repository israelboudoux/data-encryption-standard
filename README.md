# Data Encryption Standard

This is an implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It isn't fully validated yet, since the Validation Test 
is still failing. Anyway, even after the Validation Test passes, this code isn't recommended for production use and this 
algorithm is not considered safe because its short key length isn't enough to prevent brute-force attacks.

The implementation of this algorithm was followed using the instructions from the book "Understanding Cryptography - by Christof Paarjan Pelzl"

This is still a Work in Progress!
