# data-encryption-standard

This is an implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It isn't fully validated yet, since the Validation Test 
still failing. Anyway, even after the Validation Test passes, this code isn't recommended for production use and this 
algorithm is not considered since its short key length isn't enough to prevent brute force attacks, then since 1999 
NIST replaced it with the Advanced Encryption System (AES).

This is still a Work in Progress!
